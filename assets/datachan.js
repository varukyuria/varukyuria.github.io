When I was in army, a bunch of guys swore that their gf would stand by them, many accepted that they still break up. All of their women left them or cheated on them before they got home. Every single one, out of some odd 90 guys that had gfs in my unit. When anecdote happens million times, it becomes a statistic.

The i3 would technically be superior for gaming but you wouldn't notice with a 1050ti (that's called a bottleneck, to notice the difference between a Ryzen and an i3 you'd need at least a 1070 or a Vega and the Ryzen might still win depending on the game and the GPU). That being said I'm betting the superclocked 1050ti in the i3 build is just a tad bit better than whatever OEM garbage they're using on the prebuilt. The power supply in the i3 build is also superior and for all intents and purposes the motherboard in it is a bit better as well (the one in the Ryzen system is a locked down A320 and there's no reason for that). That said both use slow single channel memory but because it's single channel you could upgrade it at some point to 16GB, which is ideal. If you don't plan on upgrading in the future I'd swap the single channel with dual channel 4GB DIMMs (it costs nothing more and it's the kind of decision you can only make when building your own system).\nOh, and the most egregious fault of the Amazon system (again, other than the god awful looks) is that it lacks an SSD. If you're using Windows on a fucking hard drive, you're going to do more waiting than gaming.\nGet the i3 system, but swap out the i3 and motherboard for a 2200g Ryzen and a B350 motherboard, it's the superior platform to be on.",

I'm not really sure why he was there, and I didn't quite recognize him at first, but I did a quick google search to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing. Stallman bent over the counter, shouting into this poor girl's face about the coffee he was (or wasn't?) served. \"This is bullshit. You think this is fucking coffee? TASTE IT!\" He splashed the scalding hot water onto her face, \"Tell me if this tastes like something you'd drink, you fucking stupid BITCH.\" He pulled her hat off her head and poured the rest of his coffee down her hair as she screamed in pain-- which I think is definitely an assault charge-- and walked over to the little sandwich cooler. He picked up maybe five or six chicken paninis and said, very matter-of-factly, \"I'm taking these now.\" He sauntered out of the diner, his hands covered in coffee and full of chicken. He did one of those middle school shoulder bumps into me on the way out and said, \"Get the fuck out of my way, fanboy.\" All in all, it was a pretty good day.",

There is enough autism that everything that should be discovered has been discovered already, glitched through and tried to death over and over with titles like OoT and SM64. The only way in which something could be discovered by now is if something from these games pointed to something that didn't exist within these games (say, something like a reference to another game, movie or whatever the fuck, pretty much down to interpretation). The whole \"what did they mean by this\" with shit that looks a bit out of place or does nothing mechanically but it's there. Something like this that doesn't really have any effect ingame, but could be interpreted as something in real life. Context and shit. \n\nHowever I really doubt there is much of a point to that. It's like trying to figure out who came up with the \"mew under the truck\" thing, but then you also figure out that it's as simple as just thinking \"well shit, there's a truck over there with no purpose and people have mew, I couldn't find it elsewhere, so maybe it -is- there\". In the end it's down to a pointless interpretation of why there's a fucking truck and said truck does absolutely nothing.\n\nIn order to find anything of substance you have to look for titles that people haven't really had the opportunity to get so deep into. Modern games still today do have secrets that can be datamined, some games even lose that quick (an example is Undertale, say what you will about that game but they datamined the fucker real quick and destroyed any chance of having fun with it) but if you're going to look for actual secrets on a fucking Zelda or a Mario game, I guess go for the latest titles.",

It was incredibly durable, worked in a very wide range of temperatures, could go on thin, had a tendency to stay clean, didn't absorb water, and had a strong tendency to stay adhered to metallic surfaces it was placed on. It has reached a near mythical status in some circles today, which has only been reinforced by the 1972 whaling ban. Almost nobody under 50 years old has used it or even seen it, and what is heard about it from knowledgeable people is almost hard to believe, spoken of in often reverential tones. For these and other reasons, those few who have their irreplaceable, dwindling stocks of Sperm Whale oil tend to horde it with extreme prejudice.\n\nIt's arguable that, had we not had access to this lubricant, not only may the advent of self-loading semi and fully-automatic weapons have been pushed back decades, but possibly the entire industrial revolution would have been as well. It's hard to overstate the profound importance of whaling to the US economy throughout the entire 19th century - it was foundational. It literally lubricated the entire industrial revolution",

It seems most EE work involves grinding away on high-level programming languages for work involving embedded systems. I personally don't care at all for software, so the notion that most EE's don't even touch hardware spooks me to the core. It doesn't help that most engineers in general work in cubicle farms, which makes the already boring tasks even more miserable. \n\nI went into the field to work on designing or at least fucking optimizing electronics hardware. Everyone keeps saying that the only stable career for EE's to do actual EE work is in power engineering, while I didn't get any info on how RF/Microwave engineering and Microelectronics/IC Design are doing. I'm honestly to the point where the investment isn't worth the payoff in terms of career satisfaction, my family has a fucked budget and I'm already 21 soon 22 and stretching their patience. I'm tempted to just jump ship and go do something dumb like electrical engineering technology and just use my associates to get a jerb as a technician and be in the workforce full time, or just go for an IT associates and immerse myself in the sysadmin life. Engineering seems like grueling white collar work in cubicle farms in an economy that doesn't bother much with innovation beyond minute optimizations of existing designs around stringent constraints.

He survived many crashes.\nAfter the war, despite being severely disabled, he continued flying and combined his two hobbies. This is when he took this pictures of Edinburgh.\n\nMy issue is, how is this pictures possible?\nDidn't cameras of those days have really long exposures?

Now to make a part brighter, you block the part of the print that is exposed correctly already and keep exposing the rest. In the case of composites here, make a mask (a literal one) the shape of the sky and plane, and expose it a bit.

  "text": "While the dish is very popular in the United States, it is most often found as a variation of General Tso's chicken in North America rather than the dish found in mainland China. Chef Andy Kao claims to have developed the original Chinese-American orange chicken recipe at a Panda Express in Hawaii in 1987.[2][3] Since Panda Express is closely associated with this dish, Panda Express uses orange chicken as a promotion tool by having a dedicated food truck tour the country distributing samples of orange chicken.[4]\n\nThough called Chinese food in North America, orange chicken is rarely found in Chinese restaurants in China. Andrew Cherng, owner and founder of Panda Express, said that orange chicken is just a variation of General Tso's chicken, another dish that is almost unknown in China. Journalist Jennifer 8. Lee says that both \"General Tso's chicken and Orange Chicken are Americanized mutations of sweet and sour dishes found in China.",

  "text": "let's discuss visual influences on works.\n---\n\nI've wasted a lot of weeks this year on procrastination, watching stupid normie shit, as I've just realized. The constant entertainment with liveleak videos, memes, worthless tv series eventually gets you nowhere. You might tell yourself \"oh, maybe I can find inspiration in that!\", but it's hardly ever the case. Out of a hundred shitty videos that I've watched, one half-stupid idea for a work has emerged. At best. \n\nThis is why I say to you, you are what you eat. Look at /ic/. It is flooded with porn art. You draw porn, because you watch way too much porn. It has polluted your mind completely. And actually porn as \"reference for nudes\" is useless and deceptive, as you work from a shitty compressed screenshot of a film from most likely an extremely distorted wide-angle lense video. Which is why a lot of porn art has the very same distortions as porn. \n\nWhether it's porn, some netflix shit show, funny videos, memes, anime. You are most likely feeding your visual library with a lot of junk. The worst kind is really the normie shit, because it's letting your mind stagnate in low-tier entertainment. Where is the crazy stuff in that?\nTurn off the internet. Feed yourself obscure art, niche music, good films, art exhibitions …\n\nYou see a lot of \"I tried and failed\" threads on here and people who complain about having not enough motivation. Go on a diet, get the shit out of your system, turn the fucking internet off and draw for a week straight. \n\nPost results in here, if the thread is still alive. General discussion.",

They are not allowed to \"go native\":\n>The term ‘going native’ refers to the danger for ethnographers to become too involved in the community under study, thus losing objectivity and distance.\nThey must describe things from afar, in a conservative effort to protect their personal and cultural particularities at any time, \"their\" here referring to both the anthropologists and \"natives.\" Difference must be upheld.\n\nTo follow this imperative, our anthropologists have to watch their every move. A discipline allegedly grounded in the quest for building bridges between cultures turns out to be founded on the erection of walls.\n\nNowadays you don't have to travel very far to meet \"natives\" you aren't allowed to do cultural appropriation to: they come to your land instead of you going to them, they live a couple of city blocks away, they ride the bus with you.\n\n>Thus it came to pass that the Spartans were heroic in the day of battle; and, when the question arose whether a wall should be built about the city, the people were pleased with the man who said: \"That city is well fortified which has a wall of men instead of bricks.\" \nThe usual suspects that love to control others find their job much easier if people control themselves in the first place. They built a cage around us, made entirely of \"natives.\" It is well fortified. So fortified it's sapient.\n\nLooking at all these tribal markings and tribal warfare, you will see \"natives\" aren't foreigners - they are \"natives!\" They come in all shapes and sizes: they root for the other team, vote the other party, listen to the other band, play the other game.\n\nOne must imagine the philosopher of similarity looking to discover ways to \"go native\" with any \"natives.\"",

This is just one of the approaches to a problem. \nThe building was built at a time when design was mostly about rationalism and objectivity. People behind this movement meant it to be a “conductor”, something invisible and universal, stripped of individuality and personal vision. They didn’t want it to be expressive and focus on subject (see picrealted).\nIt may sound dogmatic, but it’s as dogmatic as your approach.\n\nSee above. It’s supposed to be depersonalized. Like it or not, it was one of the approaches of the time, which had strong roots in Netherlands too. \nAs for ‘disposable’, I was actually surprised to learnt the building was that old. I thought it could have been built yesterday. In a way it aged way better than a lot of architecture.",

I get that formal designs are rigidly placed into grids, which makes them easy to identify, so that's out of the question. I can tell semi-formal and informal designs apart when taken to extremes, but the middle grounds feel a bit muddled to me. I was hoping someone here could clear things out.\n\nTake these two Jack In the Box logos for example. Is it safe to say that the left one is Informal whereas the right one is Semi-Formal? The one int he left has little if any repetition or correlations in spacing while the one in the right at least retains some boundaries such as the limits being the same between the \"Jack\" and \"in the box\" as well as the different elements being aligned towards the center. I'd appreciate it if you guys could give me more examples to help me set these two apart. Thanks beforehand.",

I'm not really sure why he was there, and I didn't quite recognize him at first, but I did a quick google search to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was seeing. Stallman bent over the counter, shouting into this poor girl's face about the coffee he was (or wasn't?) served. \"This is bullshit. You think this is fucking coffee? TASTE IT!\" He splashed the scalding hot water onto her face, \"Tell me if this tastes like something you'd drink, you fucking stupid BITCH.\" He pulled her hat off her head and poured the rest of his coffee down her hair as she screamed in pain-- which I think is definitely an assault charge-- and walked over to the little sandwich cooler. He picked up maybe five or six chicken paninis and said, very matter-of-factly, \"I'm taking these now.\" He sauntered out of the diner, his hands covered in coffee and full of chicken. He did one of those middle school shoulder bumps into me on the way out and said, \"Get the fuck out of my way, fanboy.\" All in all, it was a pretty good day.",

I have a Docker swarm in my control, running on a cluster of servers and I have some sample web applications to deploy.

I was thinking of something like slowly increasing the requests with some software (or simply looping curl) until I ddos myself, but I haven't figured out a way of storing metrics.\n\nAnybody ever done something similar? Do you have some goto applications for this kind of stuff? I already tried using a full monitoring stack but it's overkill and adds a fair bit of overhead, and I'm more interested in network metrics anyway.\n\nAlso general devops and container discussion I guess, as long as some kind of input or a nice discussion comes out of this, I don't care.",

The browser will download a list of recommended links each day. Each link will also have a list of related websites, with similar kinds of content to that in the sponsored links. The browser will then compare these related sites to your browsing history; if there are lots of matches, Firefox will assume that you're interested in the recommended content and show it to you.\n\n>By default, Firefox will track which recommended sites you visit, and how often each recommendation is shown.\nConsidering how frequently ads are displayed will most likely be based on how many hits their searches of your browser history the terms for each ad get, this is basically Mozilla doing searches of your browser history. Also, considering how they're moving to this shit being enabled by default, how much longer until they go full Windows 10 and keep shoveling on shit that you need to opt out of and reverting some of your settings every update to wear people down? I really don't feel like needing to constantly keep up with the new ways the company that makes my browser is trying to spy on me.\n\nI should note that this is going to be rolling out with Firefox 60 which will release on May 9th and will also become the new ESR version on the same day if it follows the same trend as the past 2 ESR releases, so if you want to secure yourself against this you have just under a week to do so.\n>TFW there are no good popular browsers and this will only get worse",

Its actually been thoroughly debated before the internet in rule book deliberations in race series.\n\nAgain, rotary engines do not spin at the indicated RPM. There is a ratio approximately 1/3 between the speed of the rotor and the eccentric shaft.\n\nBut aha! Im so smart!!!!! \"The tachometer measures the speed of the eccentric/crank/flywheel\" like all you imbeciles come in thinking you are the first person to retort that. My response is the same. Look under your car (again, if you own one.) and find any kind of measurement instrument attached to your chosen of the 3 choices above. Please don't spend too long looking, you wont find a little tick wheel counting the rpm of the crank.\n\nNow google how engine RPM is actually measured. Pro tip: Its not measured from the crank in any relatively modern engine. Once you figure out how its measured, you can quickly realise how you can make any tachometer show any RPM speed you want (even just by changing the dial face)\n\n1.3L is a lie. 13b's arent 1.3L. 3 sides of the rotor fire in a revolution. You have two rotors, and you have the ratio of rotor to eccentric. Make of that what you will.",

EYS is a protein that gets secreted by the retina to protect it from damage. It also belongs to a class of protein growth factors that have some really crazy tissue regeneration properties. [1] We are going to grow it in cell cultures and then inject it, a lot like how diabetics get insulin injections.\n\n>What is your plan?\nWe are going to start by testing in zebrafish. Specially tagged EYS is going to get injected into their eye and then we will see if it goes to the right place (retinal outer segment) using fluorescent immunostaining. If all goes well, we then modify some zebrafish so that they are missing EYS, and track the visual decline of treated vs. untreated fish. Visual function is measured by wrapping the fish in a wire electrode, showing them flashes of light, and then recording the electrical signals.\n\n>Are you insane?\nNo, just extremely motivated.\n\n\n[1] https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170606095033.htm",

In primates, the volume of this area is roughly proportional to the size of the animal’s eyes, so by measuring the Neanderthals’ eye sockets, they could get a decent approximation of their the visual cortex as well. The Neanderthals, it turns out, had much larger eyes than ancient humans. The researchers speculate that this could be because they evolved exclusively in Europe, which is of higher latitude (and thus has poorer light conditions) than Africa, where H. sapiens evolved.\n\n>Along with eyes, Neanderthals had significantly larger bodies than humans, with wider shoulders, thicker bones and a more robust build overall. To account for this difference, the researchers drew upon previous research into the estimated body masses of the skeletons found with these skulls and of other Neanderthals. In primates, the amount of brain capacity devoted to body control is also proportionate to body size, so the scientists were able to calculate roughly how much of the Neanderthals’ brains were assigned to this task.\n\n>After correcting for these differences, the research team found that the amount of brain volume left over for other tasks—in other words, the mental capacity not devoted to seeing the world or moving the body—was significantly smaller for Neanderthals than for ancient H. sapiens. Although the average raw brain volumes of the two groups studied were practically identical (1473.84 cubic centimeters for humans versus 1473.46 for Neanderthals), the average “corrected” Neanderthal brain volume was just 1133.98 cubic centimeters, compared to 1332.41 for the humans.",

These recent historical events transformed the Eurasian steppe populations from being Indo-European speakers of largely western Eurasian ancestry to the present-day Turkic-speaking groups, primarily of East Asian ancestry.\nPure mutts.",

He said, \"You have been working hard at protecting this city for the country wholeheartedly. Your loyalty is uncompromised despite the long-lasting hunger. Since I can't cut out my own flesh to feed you, how can I keep this woman and just ignore the dangerous situation?\" \n\n>All the soldiers cried, and they did not want to eat. Zhang Xun ordered them to eat the flesh. Afterwards, they caught the women in the city. After the women were run out, they turned to old and young males. 20,000 to 30,000 people were eaten. People always remained loyal.\n\n>The Tang soldiers fought bravely until early October. Finally, with fewer than 400 men alive, and the men without the strength to shoot arrows, Suiyang fell to the Yan army. Zhang Xun said before the fall, \"We are out of strength, and can no longer defend the fortress. Although we have failed the emperor in life, we hope to keep killing enemies after death.\"\n\n>Zhang Xun, Nan Jiyun and Xu Yuan were all captured. Yin Ziqi asked,\"I heard that every time you fight, you open your eyelids until they rip, and you bite your teeth until they crack. Why do you do that?\" Zhang Xun answered, \"I want to eat you traitors alive. The damages to my eyes and teeth are nothing.\" Yin Ziqi used a dagger to hold open Zhang Xun's mouth, and to his surprise, all but three of Zhang Xun's teeth were indeed cracked.

They also have the added benefit of being (close to) spot, and when you meter an area, you can see the effect of that exposure on your phone to get a rough preview of what you'll get on film.\n\nThe downsides are, they don't work well on low light (I mean situations where you'd be shooting seconds long exposures) and they drain the battery. A stnadalone meter will meter minutes (or hours) long exposures, and the 9V battery will last for months.\n\nAlso, phone apps cannot meter flash or incident (that I know of), so if you're shooting with strobes a standalone meter is the only option.\n\nBtw, if you choose a lightmeter, amke sure to get one with CdS or silicon cells, the selenium ones are inconsistent and can't meter low light, only by accident will you get a fully working one.",

In the art of show business I have been in and out of many studios and sets, these locations were shown to me by my father, and his father, whose name I bear, I inhertieted this role of a pesky rabbit; but my father brought a farm after he left and has since raised carrots from the ground, and I shall be satisfied to leave my sons with a fair share of what I too received.\nThat was why I asked you the question, Doc replied, because I see that you are indifferent about the types of carrots you eat, which is a characteristic rather of those who have inherited their farms than those who have acuired them; makers, farmers have a second love for carrots as a creation of their own, resembling the affection of a perents to their child, besides natural love for carrots it is for the sake of carrots which is common for all rabbits. And hence, they are very bad company, for they can only talk and praise the nature of carrots.\nThat is true, Bug said.\nYes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What do you consider the greatest blessing you have reaped from your carrots? Doc asked.\nA full stomach! Bugs replied.\n‘A full stomach’, Doc thought, such a blessing cherishes the soul of a rabbit who lives in harmony and freedom, and is the mightinest sway of a rabbits being!\nIndeed it is, Doc.\nWell, Doc replied, but concerning the form of carrots, what is it? – To speak the truth and eat well? No, more than this? Are there not any exceptions? Suppose one of your rabbit friends has over eaten on the carrots, and he asks for another when he is not in his right minf, ought you or I give him another carrot? No one would say that I ought to give him another or do so. We must speak the truth of his condition, correct?\nYou are quite right, Doc.\nAnd who is best to do good by our friends and evil to his enemies?\nI think so.\nBy heaven then!

The closest thing to yuri Kirino says about Ruri is that she looks kawaii in the meidoneko outfit, and we all know how she likes to lewd kawaii things. Ruri is the one who actually expresses some slight yuri sentiment. Her drawing of her \"ideal future\" with the 3 of them at the table, her being the one to actually say she and Kirino are best friends and her later slip about not caring if Kyousuke had sex with Kirino (right around her also saying that Kyousuke belongs to her) subtly hints at her being fine with sharing Kyousuke at least.\n\nThe only thing we get out of Kirino on the matter is that she lets her best friend date her brother but she obviously hates it. So I doubt Kirino would be down for direct yuri. The only way I can see it happening is if Kyousuke asked for it, as Ruri already pulled the whole \"if senpai asks me to I'll do it\" line. \n\nBut I still doubt Kirino would be into it. Look at Ayase, she's yandere over Kirino so I'm sure she would love to go full yuri with her but despite Ayase considering herself to be Kirino's best friend, Kirino does nothing that suggests she wants to be yuri with Ayase.

This was the time when Game of Thrones, the tv show anyway, began and gained traction. People were done with the old, boring, simplistic and childish (as they would put it) good vs evil tales, and wanted more complexity.\n\nBut then there comes the MCU, literally the worst examples of simplistic good vs evil stories, lacking any sort of moral nuance or depth, and now both grown men and women alike are obsessing over these flicks as though a higher form of entertainment.\n\nWhat the hell happened to the rise of morally grey stories? How the hell did marvel's childish, safe, nuance-lacking good vs evil flicks become popular in such a time? How did Marvel manage to completely regress the evolution of storytelling from becoming more morally complex and naunced back to being simplistic drivel?",

If you see one and don't hunt it down it will stalk you and steal ammo/items from you and the surrounding environment. If you go to save the game at designated save station the creature abuses you in a jump scare and knocks you out, when you wake up the save station has been destroyed along with any saves you had stored at that specific spot.\n\nThe Father and The Parish:\nDeranged priest mutilated and twisted beyond recognition. The moment he notices you he summons an entire congregation of undead ghosts that have no hit boxes and can't be killed. The ghosts will chase you across the levels until you kill the Father, which can only be done using holy water blessed weapons or silver bullets\n\nThe Bootlicker:\nThis creature is drawn by the scent of blood, so if you don't burn the bodies of enemies you've killed, or patch up your wounds, then this strong creature will start stalking you. It crawls under the floor or in the walls, you can tell where it is by the long scratching noises. If you go to a safe spot while its stalking you, it will burst up and OHKO you without warning.\n\nThe Sleep:\nConcealed as a sofa/mattress/pile of garbage bags. When you get close it will lunge and you and try to swallow you whole. If it fails, it starts to rapidly balloon in sizes until its just a giant mass of puss and flesh shambling towards you.",

I have new pads and caliper rebuild kits, if needed\n\nI need to pull the door panels on the right side of the car and finishing cleaning the old grease off the window rails and putting in fresh lube.\nDid that on the left side and the windows are so much smoother.\n\nAfter that, sometime in the future, I'm thinking I'll need to do timing chain and gears, cause if they are still original, the gears will be the Nylon teeth ones and nobody wants those",

  "text": "No one else responded to this, so I hope it's not too late.\n\nIn general I would avoid having any live plants in Hermit Crab Terrariums. Their tanks need to be humid and warm all year, and even if you get a plant that can endure that, you'll have trouble getting the light it needs if you use a glass tank lid (which you probably will for Hermits since they need humidity). On top of this, the Hermits will likely decide to eat the plant anyways since they like plants as food. Lastly, since Hermit Crabs love to burrow (and need to to molt), root structures can interfere with this.\n\nI tried live plants before, but it's really just better to go with fake plants. If you really want live plants, just get cheap air plants you can toss in the tank, they'll grow and the Hermits will use them as a snack. They'll eventually need to be replaced but they should mostly be there just as a treat they can munch on over time.\n\nIf you're still determined to add a plant, I'd at least recommend you google search to make sure it's safe, since stuff like Lucky Bamboo, or anything Pine is very unhealthy for them. Also always make sure whatever plants you add aren't treated with pesticides.\n\nBut in general, fake plants are just going to be easier to work with.\n\nAlso on a related note, I'd recommend adding multiple dark shelters they can enter (such as coconut huts). I've noticed during cleaning and organizing my Hermit Crab tank that Hermit Crabs will burrow a LOT more often if you don't offer them one. Now if you want to encourage burrowing that's fine, but I personally find it easier to keep any crabs not molting on the surface for easy headcounts.",

He is incredibly selfish ,flamboyant and vain, believing himself to be the most fabulous creature alive. He used to have his own TV show but it got canceled due to nobody watching it. Madward would often bring up macabre/creepy/disturbing discussions in his show and the audience was highlly afraid. \nThen, Mettaton came into the picture and managed to steal all of his fame and fans with his TV show. \nMadward 's insanity was awakened by Mettaton and he hates the robot with all his heart. \nI can see him working at his meat store ,cutting beef while watching the tiny TV in the corner, seeing Mettaton at his concerts being applauded and cheeref on by entire crowds of people while stepping on the red carpet. Madward would be watching all that with his teeth gritted afterwards throwing a freshly chicken throat at the TV with rage, scaring his customers away. \nMaddie, then decided it's time to step up and do something to feed his Mettaton hatred. Sometimes, he would call Mettaton 's fans and tell them to gather to the dark alley by lying to them that he saw their idol there. All the fans would gather there expecting to see Mettaton and Madward would come out and stab to them with his butcher knife. \nAfter a while, Maddie got bored and decided he needs to step up & hit the big superstar himself. \nMettaton was really worried about his fans dieing and being murdered all of a sudden. \nDuring one of his shows, Madward disguised himself as a stagehand and sneaked into the studio. He tied Mettaton up and went on the stage himself by claiming to everyone that their favorite robot star has a cold.",

The amount of light your lens lets in will not change, only the depth of field or the “blurry part” of the image. \"\n\nI was calculating 35mm at f/8 and got 52.5 mm f/12\n\nSo what the fuck does that mean? Should I be shooting at f/5.6 to get an image as sharp as possible? Or is my lens still sharp at f/8 but will produce a deeper field and that's all?",

And if you're arguing that the average woman is incapable of understanding the arts, then you've been on this board for too long and are an idiot. Do you actually think the average man outside of /mu/ even so much as cares about, or even understands basic principles of artistry? Hell, most men aren't nearly as interested in the arts; when have you ever seen a Theater/Drama, Painting/Drawing or Music class where the males heavily outnumber the females? Or when a woman takes her boyfriend to a show that isn't commercialized garbage and measures whether or not the male retains any sort of interest? Or even so much as display a level of spontaneity or creativity when making art anyways? If you think females are incapable of perceiving the arts in any sort of significant manner, then you're a philistine. Such sexist ideals should not, should have never, and will never be thought of anymore in the realm of art. Good riddance, you disgusting cherubim.",

But there are only so many seats at a firm - and you have to live in a huge city to take those seats, the rest of us freelance, and take it on the chin for a fixed check along the way. \n\nOh also, most freelance shit is a shitshow too, at least in terms of who you will \"network\" with street level. If you want comfy money and good work, look at other STEM stuff - graphic design is kinda for snowflakes and tryhards TBQH, that said I love it, and I'll eat a bullet at 60 when I'm finally kicked out the door because every other job sucks. \n\nHey tell that chink faglord who runs this shit that (youing) a bunch of your own posts isn't spam - I had to pull them from the post because master of the retarded filtered shit in the absolute most haram way possible.",

And the fact that so many people like this awful show is irritating, it bothers me because I went into it with moderate expectations only to be bored to fucking death for 14 episodes before deciding that there is zero redeeming qualities in this trash series.\n\nThe dialogue is cringey as fuck. If you’re going to have a show about “heroes and villains” a concept so redundant and tired at least have some kind of self-awareness and 4th wall humor. There’s no depth to the show whatsoever. There are no interesting characters that draw you in, everyone in this show is a fucking borefest. I found myself predicting everything that was going to happen in every episode. There’s no twists, no turns. The heroes are just a bunch of bootlickers, the villains are cookie-cutter idiots. “Hah hah hah, we’re evil!

And nothing comes from it. He never loses any power. He never loses anything, really. There were some scars, but they've never really done much of anything to hinder him. The main villain can't die because he's the second main character, and it's not like the main character can die. It's not JoJo. Hell, Deku even got a magical loli that just somehow had the ability to reverse all his injuries. And hey, All Might was supposed to die? Well not with Deku around, with his second quirk being the ability to change fate. You'd think he had a black cat to do that, right? Or hell, why doesn't he just close his eyes and ask One For All for help? It sure didn't hurt to get help from them during the tournament arc, somehow breaking the mind-control power that was unbeatable with just using strength. The issue isn't that Deku lost, because he was always going to win until he got a cool fight that would sell tanks. It's that Hori thought it'd be interesting to put Deku up against a hero he could never beat and have him beat him by introducing a random second power to One For All that never got brought up again.

Even though she acts mature, calm and collected most of the time, she freaks out from things she's afraid of, are gross, or pertain to gore. She is a tsundere towards Ritsu, often due to Ritsu's immaturity. Because of her extreme shyness, she chose the bass over the more conspicuous guitar. She is so delicate that merely imagining herself being the center of attention almost makes her faint. She plays the bass quite well. She is kind and warm with others, caring about her friends and knowing they are important to her.\n\nAlthough she is not altogether uninterested in joining a band outside school, the time she spends with the Light Music Club members is the time she enjoys the most, so she has completely devoted herself to the club, and during the school festival performance in the fall of her first high school year, she acted as lead vocalist instead of Yui, who had lost her voice at that time. It seemed like Mio might have overcome her stage fright, but after the performance ended, she tripped over a cord and fell, exposing her panties, and was traumatized anew.\n\nPrevious thread:",

It is always best to test where you find them to verify working, but to bring home and clean good. Systems get warm, and will smell like the house you get them from. A good disassemble and wash down in Dawn dish detergent and hot water of all plastic parts helps, but the smell of pets and smoking is hard to get off the PCB. I have bought systems that cats have pissed on, and that smell never leaves. Clean it as best you can and hopefully sell it to another cat owner. \n\n\n>Thanks for keeping reddit alive on 4chan.\nThanks for autistically focusing on two sentences of my whole post and being \"triggered\" by my experience with cockroaches. They are very real, and very dangerous to anyone trying to avoid them infesting their home. I am only suggesting that the best way to not have them in your home is to not bring them in, but that ONCE you get them, you might as well move or burn your house down. They are quite common in the sale and trade of old electronics as other anons mentioned.\n\nAlso, I have never used reddit. Thanks for the shallow insult though. If it \"triggers\" you that I mixed experience with caution, think about it the next time you eat at a restaurant. There is a high probability that the kitchen has them.",

His ex-girlfriend Ann is a lawyer who dumped him because of his drinking and works for LF. She decides to give him another chance, but Eddie blows it by accusing LF CEO Carl Drake during an interview.\n\nJenny Slate is a scientist working for the Life Foundation who decides to help Brock. She reveals they are trying to bond people with alien symbiotes. Eddie breaks into the facility with her credentials, is attacked by one of the hybrids and bonds with Venom, which begins communicating with him. Eddie/Venom kills LF goons sent after him and goes on the run.\n\nAfter killing some crooks, Eddie/Venom decides to go after the LF. Drake hires merc Woody Harrelson to capture him and he does using Ann as bait. Eddie gets tortured and separated from Venom, but Slate breaks him out (gets killed). Eddie and Venom rebond, rescue Ann, kills Harrelson and his men and fight the hybrids. Drake gets fused with one (called Lasher) and there’s a big fight. Eddie kills Drake/Lasher, says goodbye to Ann and leaves to keep up being a lethal protector.\n\nAfter-credits is the Carnage symbiote escaping from confinement and crawling to the cell of Cletus Cassidy, who is one of LF’s subjects.

Both of these guns shoot great and very very easy to control. I forget i'm shooting my 1911 sometimes b/c it feels like my 92. Yet, joke is on the person, you are shooting a round that will drop anyone without the proper protection on them in one or two rounds compared to the 9mm. Both still great guns.\n\nRealistically, against the common criminal, if you need more than 8 rounds. You are in VERY deep trouble. Especially if you are using a high power revolver or 1911.",

But the flip side is that an M car would be more expensive and have higher running costs, plus I would just be driving around time 98% of the time.\n\nI’m thinking of just doing some minor mods, (stage 1, coil overs, wheels/tires) and keeping the F30 as a daily.

Worse case scenario disregulation ot homeostasis because of POMC neuron death because of HDF.\nA recent paper published discredits 1 since it showed that transport across the BBB remains the same in lean and DIO (diet induced obesity) mouse models.\nAny ideas on what could be causing leptin resistance at the cellular level?\nTurns out",

And it doesn't take very long. Researchers injected a male rat with a dopamine agonist (a drug that mimics dopamine), and then placed him in a cage with another male. The two rats just hung out together for a day. (The dopamine agonist is out of the system in about one day.) Researchers repeated this 2 more times, 4 days apart.\nA few days later, the reconditioned male was put to the test. With no dopamine agonist in his system, he was placed into a cage with his male buddy and sexually receptive female (remember the dopamine was out of his system). Guess which rat turned him on the most? He showed much more response to the male: more erections, more genital investigation, and even female-like solicitations —as opposed to normal male mounting behavior.\nLesson? High levels of dopamine can powerfully rewire the brain and alter sexual tastes. The researchers emphasized that the male rat wasn't gay, as he didn't try to mount the other rat. Yet he had definitely changed. Similarly, continued porn use cannnot change your sexual orientation, but it can change what type of porn excites you.\n\nLink to Enhaced D2-type receptor activity facilitates the development of conditioned same-sex partner preference \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22564860/",

Don't get the size of the pen-display based on budget, but on whether it works for your type of work or workflow. If you're serious about drawing, spend an extra hundred or so dollars.\n\n\n\nFrom what I heard, pressure levels are just a meme. If you absolutely don't care about adobe RGB coverage and can't wait for the new XP-pen 22 inch for whatever reason, then get the current one with 2048 levels or pressure sensitivity. Higher levels of pressure sensitivity is just an added bonus. The other plus of waiting for the newer version most likely means you will be buying the one with updated technology, such as improvements on what the company did wrong in the past models. \n\n>also, does it make sense investing in a bigger screen tablet if i already own a huge non screen one?\n\nPen display is probably where you want a bigger screen size since there will be other things on the screen other than the canvas, and drawing tablet without the screen is the one where you should just have got a medium.\n\n>which brand/size does the real pros use?\n\nMostly Wacom, but that's because they had a monopoly on the pen-display and drawing tablets for a while. Buy from the smaller guys to increase competition. Brand shouldn't matter for drawing but would indirectly matter for quality. Right now I hear a lot of good things about XP-pen from my research. I especially like the 92% adobe RGB coverage they are aiming for. Their Amazon reveals don't do as well, but there are a lot of shill reviews. You can tell how active these new drawing tablet brands like Huion or XP-pen are on social media by how many of their models are being sent to be reviewed by youtubers. I would imagine some of them may be shilling Amazon reviews as well, against the competition or for their own product. So don't just read Amazon reviews for this, try to find an unbiased source for the review.",

So no need for a monitor to check colors at least. \n\nI'd recommend. I'm not saying you could get screwed over. Sure you could. Anything \"no matter how expensive\" or whose on the label doesn't = 100% flawless and such.\n\nJust give them a chance, if you do that and it works out. Great less money same tools.

I started working a full time job and filled the void in my life by drawing chinese cartoons. \n\nTwo years in, I told myself that this isn't the life that I wanted and forced myself to become more proactive in my social life, In college, everything formed naturally, girls were always there, everyone was looking for relationships, but post college you need decent social skills to make new friends. \n\nSo, I spent the past 5 months, getting back in shape, improving my clothing and grooming style, and constantly going to events SOLO in my community. Luckily, I live in a city so there is always shit going on. In the process, I've made like 3-4 good friends, and a group of \"party bois\" who I hang out with regularly, I pretty much party like 3 nights a week now. My social skills have gotten tremendously better from all the cold approaches I've been doing. \n\nAnyway, a typical day would be work/volunteer/gym and then party. I try to force myself to draw but that motivation just isn't there. Seems like you have to be a depressed nutcase to make it as an artist.",

Changing it it too early can interrupt and slow down this process, risk infection etc and increase the likelyhood of problems in the future like reocurring infection.\n\npersonally i would get both ears pierced but thats just me hating asymmetry. gonna get two more soon.\nHowever, its not like you will not be able to get the second one pierced another time if you dont like only one.

I can tell semi-formal and informal designs apart when taken to extremes, but the middle grounds feel a bit muddled to me. I was hoping someone here could clear things out.\n\nTake these two Jack In the Box logos for example. Is it safe to say that the left one is Informal whereas the right one is Semi-Formal? The one int he left has little if any repetition or correlations in spacing while the one in the right at least retains some boundaries such as the limits being the same between the \"Jack\" and \"in the box\" as well as the different elements being aligned towards the center. I'd appreciate it if you guys could give me more examples to help me set these two apart. Thanks beforehand.",

Here's a list I've made of names that could give you some inspiration:\nhttps://pastebin.com/33JvsZ4N\nAlso there's a few things you could try, I would recommend combining an acronym or numbers that are meaningful to you (like a year or initials) with an interesting name (eg. ActionXL, Planet51, JGLimited, Division13)\n\n>Coming up with a versatile logo that fits into the market. EX Rockstar has claimed yellow/black, Monster has claimed Green. Etc. \nComing up with a logo could be complicated, again if you're serious you can either take your time and research how good logos are made or hire a graphic designer (although it could be tricky to find someone who could really nail the look you're going for) check out this vid for an example of how to design a logo/branding:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR7tMnKghDs \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBTiTcHm_ac",
