Tsubasa are most likely to be aired because ETC is aiming mostly for recent animu and dorama. Besides, chilean audience is mildly pissed with recent dubs and Toei's decisions of replacing the old masters with funimation cropped shit for DBZ and other animu. Other issue is ETC being technically, a monopoly in anime broadcasting here. Without competence, there is less chances to get animu at cheaper prices. Local regulations don't help it and make things harder (the chilean National Television Council has banned the anime from the national air tv because of its content, local school system has children from 8AM to 5PM, killing potential audience in home, new regulations about unhealthy food has banned sponsoring of Junk food and other things high on sugar and saturated fat like Cheetos, Frost Flakes and similars and that affected the net income of almost every local, cable and national tv stations... only a small bunch of small regional tv stations in Constitucion, Temuco, and Iquique air anime, although illegal, TV is on crisis and some big channels are on the verge of closing or externalizing their production).

So far I'm pleased with the voices quality, Battler is very entertaining despite looking like a retard. Pretty much like Maria, in fact. Some scenes happened to play out with different tones in my mind though. It's fortunate that I already know how this episode and the whole novel play out, because otherwise I would have dropped the novel. If you want to truly appreciate the voice acting, you have to bear through the slowness of the text. And if you want to read at your own speed, then you'd have to skip and it would completely ruin the point of having those in the first place. Pretty much a deal killer for me, considering how boring Legend is at the beginning...  Anyway, this episode is pretty heavy in terms of foreshadowing, it's incredible. A plethora of little details are thrown here and there in unexpected ways, such as that moment when Maria is glad to be called associable when she learns that Kanon is often called that too. Why would she want to be like him, of all people? Or that moment when Genji only talks to Shannon in the corridor, when technically Kanon was still there talking with her just seconds ago. He couldn't have disappeared in such a short time... Or even when the narration describes Battler with words such as \"big\" and \"strong\" when Kanon was reminiscing how he helped him with the fertilizer bags. This may be my personal interpretation on this one I admit but it's very interesting",

    "text": "Despite problems (reviews thus far are mixed, with 15 of the 36 reviews to date being negative with those negative reviews being in a variety of languages, but mainly English and Korean), Princess Maker 5 has thus far peaked at 184 concurrent users, well above the 71 concurrent users Princess Maker 1 and 79 concurrent users Princess maker 3 reached, though behind the 245 peak of Princess Maker 2. It did so with a higher base price than any of the prior releases, $30 for this compared to $20 for 2 and 3 and $10 for 1. Based on the timing of its daily peaks, it looks to be doing better in Asia, although it has maintained numbers above 70 concurrent users at times which would favor the West. Either way, with its concurrent users peaks thus far it looks to be off to a rather strong start, and the series has historically had relatively strong legs with all three prior entries selling long after their initial release. Sales estimate through the end of Steam Spy of prior entries look to be roughly   Princess Maker - 12k Princess Maker 2 - 30k Princess Maker 3 - 8k  While Princess Maker 5 does have achievements, the global achievement method begins to break down by 500 owners (since the achievement charts only have 3 significant digits, and above 500 you begin to have gaps of 0.1), which Princess Maker 5 seems to have quickly eclipsed within hours, thus it doesn't do anything here.",

    "text": "Fureraba has thus far peaked at 61 concurrent users at Steam which is a rather strong showing for a recent moege, especially one as the first release by a new company. The daily peaks thus far have been at times which favor European and North American customers over Asian customers, although it picked up a quick burst of Chinese reviews at launch as well. That said, it may end up peaking higher than 61, as its current peak has only come within the last couple hours. It had been delayed on Steam because of delays with Valve approving it, but I have to wonder if the generally positive reception it got while being a purely R18 release helped it get a better launch than it otherwise would have once it finally made it to Steam. Of course though, even if it is doing relatively well compared to other recent releases by other companies, how well it did for NekoNyan would depend on their expectations and expenses which are of course unknowable, and there is little indication about exactly how well it sold on any of the non-Steam platforms.   With having no Kickstarter and likely having a meaningful fraction of its sales being on off Steam R18 platforms, MG titles are probably the best to compare to as launch strength, which are as follows (excluding peaks during bundles). It is worth remembering though, that concurrent users at launch only represents the strength of a title at launch, rather than how it will sell down the road.   Eden - 302 (During the Summer 2015 sale, day 1 peak of 130) Higurashi ch 1 - 268 (During the Summer 2015 sale, day 2 peak of 255) Ozmafia - 246 (day 3 peak) Kindred Spirits - 228 (day 3 peak) Umineko: Golden Fantasia - 187 (day 1 peak) Go Go Nippon - 181 (during a sale, launch peak not available) Remembering How We Met - 174 (day 2 peak) Fashioning Little Miss Lonesome - 109 (day 3 peak) Higurashi ch 2 - 88 (day 1 peak) Umineko - 75 (day 2 peak) Princess Evangile - 66 (day 4 peak)",

The cave was also impossibly hard to navigate. Stuff really is more impressive to little children than they really are. It doesn't help that the cave is made of skulls and that horrified me. Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to make the third stage in a children's game a cave made of bone and skulls?

Apparently someone at Bungie sent a fan a copy of the original source code, and that person then ported the game, rather faithfully (if not a bit buggy), to modern macOS.  I played it for a little bit and got kinda interested. It's clearly an early FPS in the vein of Wolfenstein 3D, but it also has adventure / dungeon-crawling elements, like a detailed inventory with weighted, equippable items, an ability to examine items on the ground, and a resting feature to regain lost health.  Gameplay is pretty slow; there's literally no run button, so you just walk everywhere. The only enemy I've encountered so far is this pretty goofy alien mouth-thing with legs and a tail that projectile-spits green goo and emits a high-pitched monkey-like yelp when injured. And because player movement is so slow, it's easy to get hit by the goo in the narrow spaces you're exploring. I've already died twice on the second floor. Also, the game has absolutely no music or ambient sounds, which is kinda shitty.  So, has anyone else played through Pathways? Should I keep going?",

This provides your recruitment base, a place to hide or sleep if you and your home are compromised, hiding places for your weapons, among other things. As a guerrilla you are in it for the long haul. It will likely be a long time before you have a network good enough to support your operations.  From there, unarmed recon, thievery, and sabotage will be your best options. You dont have to kill, just make it an absolute nightmare for the enemy to be there. You attract attention by killing in your fledgling state, and you will be hunted down and crushed.  Graduate little by little until you are big enough to strike, and even then you’ll only be able to strike at softer targets like the police. Rather than the Natguard or whoever they send.",

Do you think it will come back, or does it not feel safe here anymore? What do I do about this bengal? Do I throw water on it to make it fuck off? Do you think this skittish but well demeanored black kitten is socializable? Im thinking it should come back as long as I give it food.

In reality they will stick some rad-hardened components on it, which are still slower than commercial, but not insanely slower like mechanical would be. >So the computer is mainly just there to reverse the direction, turn, then go back to moving a straight line. If they just pipe the data back to earth and send commands from there, it would not require as much computation, but then you have to deal with propogation delays which would limit capabilities. They will want to make the rover autonomous and that requires a lot of computational capability, even for just driving around and navigating the terrain.  The Curiosity rover used redundant RAD750 CPUs, which are still very slow by today's standards.

The Pokemon Master still had Arceus and Giratina, Tyris showing her love with Zoroark defeated Arceus and Giratina easily, she discovered she broke her limit as human like Zoroark with their secret one year trainning at day care, even two legendaries were'nt enough to defeat her, The Pokemon Master decided to fight against Tyris himself, but he lacked love, he never bred like Tyris, she easily defeated the Pokemon Master and got his tittle... and virginity, it was her special move.",

Gorske was surrounded by family, friends and Big Mac lovers as they watched him take a bite of Big Mac number 30,000. Gorske has been eating Big Macs at least two Big Mac's a day since he took his first bite in 1972. He saves the wrappers, receipts, and bags for proof.  \"When I had a Big Mac that was the best food I ever had. I knew I was going to be eating them every day,\" Don Gorske said.  In Big Mac attire, his proud brother Daniel Gorske came to support him. But, 40 years ago, he was a little skeptical.  \"I didn't understand the magnitude of what that would become. It's been a neat journey to see him,\" Daniel Gorske said.  Don Gorske has been featured in the Guinness World Records and the film Super Size Me. After Friday's record-breaking Big Mac, Gorske said he's already looking forward to the next milestone and doesn't plan to stop anytime soon.  \"The wife jokes it will be over when I have to put it in a blender it's over,\" Gorske said. \"I don't think it would even be over then.\"  ",

    "text": "An early enthusiast for the Melville Revival, British author E. M. Forster, remarked in 1927: \"Moby-Dick is full of meanings: its meaning is a different problem.\"[19] Yet he saw as \"the essential\" in the book \"its prophetic song\", which flows \"like an undercurrent\" beneath the surface action and morality.[20]  Biographer Laurie Robertson-Lorant sees epistemology as the book's theme. Ishmael's taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates \"the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty\". She also contrasts Ishmael and Ahab's attitudes toward life, with Ishmael's open-minded and meditative, \"polypositional stance\" as antithetical to Ahab's monomania, adhering to dogmatic rigidity.[21]  Melville biographer Delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences. All races are represented among the crew members of the Pequod. Although Ishmael initially is afraid of Queequeg as a tattooed cannibal, he soon decides, \"Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\"[22] While it may be rare for a mid-19th century American book to feature black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. The theme of race is primarily carried by Pip, the diminutive black cabin boy.[23] When Pip has almost drowned, Ahab, genuinely touched by Pip's suffering, questions him gently, Pip \"can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: 'Pip! Reward for Pip!'\".[24]  Editors Bryant and Springer suggest perception is a central theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: \"All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks\" — and Ahab is determined to \"strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall\" (Ch. 36, \"The Quarter-Deck\"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in \"The Doubloon\" (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab \"discover no sign\" (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word \"discover\" to \"perceive\", and with good reason, for \"discovery\" means finding what is already there, but \"perceiving\", or better still, perception, is \"a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it\".[25] The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.[25]  Yet Melville does not offer easy solutions. Ishmael and Queequeg's sensual friendship initiates a kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crew's dancing erupts into racial conflict in \"Midnight, Forecastle\" (Ch. 40).[13] Fifty chapters later...",

Tsubasa are most likely to be aired because ETC is aiming mostly for recent animu and dorama. Besides, chilean audience is mildly pissed with recent dubs and Toei's decisions of replacing the old masters with funimation cropped shit for DBZ and other animu. Other issue is ETC being technically, a monopoly in anime broadcasting here. Without competence, there is less chances to get animu at cheaper prices. Local regulations don't help it and make things harder (the chilean National Television Council has banned the anime from the national air tv because of its content, local school system has children from 8AM to 5PM, killing potential audience in home, new regulations about unhealthy food has banned sponsoring of Junk food and other things high on sugar and saturated fat like Cheetos, Frost Flakes and similars and that affected the net income of almost every local, cable and national tv stations... only a small bunch of small regional tv stations in Constitucion, Temuco, and Iquique air anime, although illegal, TV is on crisis and some big channels are on the verge of closing or externalizing their production).

However I realized that I had left my car unlocked, so I started leaving  But for some reason I couldn't bring my 300$ outside, so I needed to find somewhere to hide it inside the arcade so I could grab it when I came back from the parking lot.  Before I left, I noticed there was a mini indoor 9-person ferris wheel where the seats are individual enclosed dark pods with lights and screens inside  I slid my 300$ under the seat when I walked back to the car  When I returned, my 300$ was not there Someone must have thought it was their dead drop for a drug deal. However in my seat, I found a giant Cirno fumo and in her lap a gift basket filled 6 regular fumos and a bunch of touhou merchandise.

A gravure idol (グラビアアイドル gurabia aidoru), often abbreviated to gradol (グラドル guradoru), is a Japanese female model who primarily models on magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. Gravure idols appear in a wide range of photography styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure models may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude.  > Sales Rankings  > What's New",

As you said the Rose of Bantry had one, but this one is lively, detailed, with variety and different streets. It's funny how it's more heterogeneous looking than the City portayed in Garrett's Revenge, even if there's nothing to look for here. All the loot needed in expert can be found in the three restricted zones. Some neat architectural touches, like the colonnade around the mansion, the upper galleries in the church or the canal full of boats, that characterize the \"useful\" parts of the City. Sometimes it's the most simple stuff that gives depth to a mission. The same goes for the interiors. The mansion is circular like many others but the circle patrolled by the guards consits of two floors. The church develops vertically and every floor has Hammers watching over the one below, especially the priest in the bell tower.  New stuff on the gameplay side too, like witnessing the completion of a rival thief hit (to your detriment) or being able to get the key for the manor's back entrance only with the permit from the temple.  Can you recognize the sound used for the drawbridge? It could be from any TDP mission and I just forgot it, but after seeing the red hammer on Brother Roban's model I started wondering if that one was the only custom element of the FM.",

The problem here is lack of focus.  Second, price.

It's just a bad business move. If you price your cart at 40$, 5 people might buy it and you will make 200$. But if you price it at 200$, 0 people will buy it because it's way too expensive, and you will make 0$.

I think the knowledge that this is not a real prison would fuel a lot of my rebellion but who knows what kind of mental breakdown I would have if I were actually in there. The prisoners started to believe that it was an actual prison and I suppose it essentially was. I immerse myself way too much into movies and perhaps it is a testament of how great the acting was but I really wanted to clock those stupid guards.

You can also call him Maddie on short since he doesn't mind.  Madward is a ghoul who works as a butcher for a meat company. He is incredibly selfish ,flamboyant and vain, believing himself to be the most fabulous creature alive. He used to have his own TV show but it got canceled due to nobody watching it. Madward would often bring up discussions in his show and the audience was highlly afraid.  Then, Mettaton came into the picture and managed to steal all of his fame and fans with his TV show.  Madward 's insanity was awakened by Mettaton and he hates the robot with all his heart.  I can see him working at his meat store ,cutting beef while watching the tiny TV in the corner, seeing Mettaton at his concerts being applauded and cheeref on by entire crowds of people while stepping on the red carpet. Madward would be watching all that with his teeth gritted afterwards throwing a freshly chicken throat at the TV with rage, scaring his customers away.  Maddie, then decided it's time to step up and do something to feed his Mettaton hatred. Sometimes, he would call Mettaton 's fans and tell them to gather to the dark alley by lying to them that he saw their idol there. All the fans would gather there expecting to see Mettaton and Madward would come out and stab to them with his butcher knife.  After a while, Maddie got bored and decided he needs to step up & hit the big superstar himself.  Mettaton was really worried about his fans dieing and being murdered all of a sudden.  During one of his shows, Madward disguised himself as a stagehand and sneaked into the studio. He tied Mettaton up and went on the stage himself by claiming to everyone that their favorite robot star has a cold.",

There is smoothness and a lack of texture. Obviously it's a lack of grain, because there is no grain in digital. It adds something that I've rarely seen in a film image.   >I've done no scientific tests yet, but it seems to me there is anywhere from a half stop of additional dynamic range from the D30 over transparency film.   >A print like this needs a minimum of 240DPI, and these images are 6x9 at that size, so to make a print that's bigger then 6x9 you have to do what's called \"resing it up\". The most effective way of doing this is to use a program called Genuine Fractals Pro. It effectively allows you to make much bigger images without losing quality. It can't create information that isn't there, but what it does is that it extrapolates the information without degrading image quality, which is what would've happened if you were to use for example bicubic interpolation that Photoshop uses when you increase the size of an image from its original pixel density.   >The important thing is that here we have an image that's roughly 12x15 or 12x16, that is about the biggest size one could normally make from a 35mm frame before you start to lose quality.   >The image quality here is as good as one could want (for this size).

The only place they went wrong on the Df is no split-image focus screen and no interchangeable screens, FFS a Canon 5D from 2005 has this and takes the FE's focus screen without modification, Nikon seriously dropped the ball here majorly. So yes, that's where it went wrong, but otherwise the Df is a solid performer, it does low-light well and can use literally every Nikon F mount lens ever made since 1959, with no modification, even those weird ultrawides carried over from the S rangefinder that require mirror lockup.",

    "text": "An early enthusiast for the Melville Revival, British author E. M. Forster, remarked in 1927: \"Moby-Dick is full of meanings: its meaning is a different problem.\"[19] Yet he saw as \"the essential\" in the book \"its prophetic song\", which flows \"like an undercurrent\" beneath the surface action and morality.[20]  Biographer Laurie Robertson-Lorant sees epistemology as the book's theme. Ishmael's taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates \"the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty\". She also contrasts Ishmael and Ahab's attitudes toward life, with Ishmael's open-minded and meditative, \"polypositional stance\" as antithetical to Ahab's monomania, adhering to dogmatic rigidity.[21]  Melville biographer Delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences. All races are represented among the crew members of the Pequod. Although Ishmael initially is afraid of Queequeg as a tattooed cannibal, he soon decides, \"Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\"[22] While it may be rare for a mid-19th century American book to feature black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. The theme of race is primarily carried by Pip, the diminutive black cabin boy.[23] When Pip has almost drowned, Ahab, genuinely touched by Pip's suffering, questions him gently, Pip \"can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: 'Pip! Reward for Pip!'\".[24]  Editors Bryant and Springer suggest perception is a central theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: \"All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks\" — and Ahab is determined to \"strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall\" (Ch. 36, \"The Quarter-Deck\"). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in \"The Doubloon\" (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab \"discover no sign\" (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word \"discover\" to \"perceive\", and with good reason, for \"discovery\" means finding what is already there, but \"perceiving\", or better still, perception, is \"a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it\".[25] The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.[25]  Yet Melville does not offer easy solutions. Ishmael and Queequeg's sensual friendship initiates a kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crew's dancing erupts into racial conflict in \"Midnight, Forecastle\" (Ch. 40).[13] Fifty chapters later...",

Take these two Jack In the Box logos for example. Is it safe to say that the left one is Informal whereas the right one is Semi-Formal? The one int he left has little if any repetition or correlations in spacing while the one in the right at least retains some boundaries such as the limits being the same between the \"Jack\" and \"in the box\" as well as the different elements being aligned towards the center.

You took your BTC profits.  2) Mid term coin shows steady growth, but due to overall market it could possibly have a dip to levels you had bought in earlier, but could not dip and continue to steady grow.  A) Sell your stack at +10% to buy the dip B) Don't sell your stack, but use gains from previous short term coin to buy the dip if it happens  3) Your long term coin is trading +/- sideways, sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down, but clearly many people are accumulating, moon mission is 6-18 months away",

Iron Hands is a trading philosophy that believes that trying to time the market on a micro scale is the fastest way to lose money. We try to remove luck from the question by buying into projects we believe have a serious future and holding our positions for months or years.  Why hold instead of daytrading? Because the vast majority of people who daytrade lose money. With luck on your side, swing trading CAN be much more profitable — but the odds are just as good that you’ve called your position incorrectly and will lose out. Beyond the financial benefits of holding, the best thing offered by holding is peace of mind. Iron hands are numb to the feelings of despair and panic that cause other traders to sell at a loss. Because we look ahead to the horizon, short term bearish trends can be ignored.  Why is margin trading bad? Cryptocurrency is an unregulated market. This is both a great thing and a terrible curse. There are several instances in recent memory of enormous, manipulated short squeezes liquidating millions and planting that money firmly into the pockets of the exchanges. Remember: margin trading is gambling at a casino where the house openly cheats.  What do Iron Hands hold? Anything and everything. If your hands are made of metal and your eyes are on the future, it doesn’t matter what’s in your bags.",

As he is imploring them to make their escape, they both get on their knees, bowing and crying while thanking him. Instead of accepting this, he gets extremely angry and shouts at them to stop, saying \"I hate pathetic people!\" This stuck with me, and ever since I've watched the film, I've stopped caring about being single, I've stopped caring about what people think, I've stopped feeling sorry for myself.

Only if you sweat a lot. Even then, most gyms will have paper towel dispensers so you can clean your sweaty equipment with those. >>What should i do when i'm doing a pause between sets?

Roxas at the very least lived an illusion of one, her entire existence was nothing but being a dedicated plot point and she never complained once. I really hope she also get to come back when Roxas and Xion inevitably do in KH3.",

After all, Mei did say yes four times in the library when she promised to Yuzu to love her and be at her side.   It would be a nice reversal, but, I don't want Yuzu to be a copy of Mei. Maybe the end of the volume will be Mei coming back to Yuzu who smiles, but puts her hands on Mei's shoulders and say \"sorry...\".

Yuzu could think she's the default choice since Mei would be relieved of her duty. And so, another string of chapters for Mei to learn to really know Yuzu and to act an active part in rebuilding their relationship. But yeah, that would be in an optimistic view of the way the author writes her plot.  Easy road, Saint Yuzu saves the day and has no doubt to accept Mei back.

That particular interview was never translated until recently, so many still assumed the prototype (labeled as such because it never released) was a fake, until the official GBA port in 2003 ported its newly added scenes, removed scenes, and the dash feature and put a rest to the argument as you said.  Answering :  The main versions are: - Original JP NES version (Mother). Some content is unique to it like the Time Machine but it's not of much consequence. - Official US NES version (Earth Bound), unreleased until 2014 (VC), adds dash option and story scenes and censors some references and things NoA doesn't like (more censored than Earthbound/M2), leaked as EB Zero, then then 3DS/WiiU VC. - Mother 1+2 (GBA) based on the NES version additions/cuts. Not bad (but M2, oh boy...) - Tomato's fan-translation of Mother 1+2 (GBA) - redone uncensored translation without NES space limitations or NoA censorship, plus an optional \"Easy Ring\" that rebalances the game to be much less grindy.  Then there are various NES romhacks that backport each version's most remarkable features to the NES version, either fixing just the title screen and sprites, the spots where NoA cut things in the script, or replacing the entire script with the retranslation (still cut down to fit)...",

FFX ruined this shit, not a single point in the game were the bosses difficult in the storyline. It was literal point a-b and I never once had to optimize.  FFVII was perfect, the scorpion boss in cloud's home town, the weapons,  So many points that if you didn't grind just a little bit the fights could actually be pretty intense. Which actually made grinding fun, playing it as a child it was like damn that boss was tough. Maybe I need to be a little bit stronger or get that next spell level. When you get to the three part boss battle at the end it was fun as shit with no grind and actually felt like you were accomplishing something.

The most obvious similarity with the game being the general theme of a group of boys going on a journey (albeit more local than international like the Gaia crew) and dealing with adult matters the best a young person can deal. Others include them playing cards early on in the film at their treehouse hideout vs Gaia's seaside cave, Teddy Duchamp's mentally unstable father vs Rob/Lance's mentally challenged father, and a reference to vampires on a magazine (Gaia has a pair of boss vampires). Female characters are glaringly absent in the movie and probably book, so perhaps Ohara was also conscious of this as she penned Illusion of Gaia's story?

Looking at IoG, that seems obvious, and in Terranigma it can be seen as well, even though it works much better there.

Lowest cost of entry with most amount of track time is motocross or stock car racing.   In Europe you're fucked because racing is seen as a gentlemen's club instead of an inclusive saturday night activity. Don't even bother trying if you're in Europe.  If you have a dirt bike already, motocross is literally just email the nearest track and ask when the track is open for public riding, then go around and introduce yourself.  Stock car racing, go to a local event, after the last feature race they'll let you walk into the pits. Go up to the guy who won the fwd 4 cylinder class, ask if there's anyone in the field who does \"arrive and drive\" stuff. They will say yes because everybody does, they will only say no if it's obvious you're special needs.   Firesuit will run you $100, most tracks allow full-faced motorcycle helmets (at least in 4-cyl classes) so that's $170. Hans devices are optional at that level because of the reduced speeds. I know my guys were charging between $100 and $150 per race plus whatever damage occurred.  That's literally it. I think my first year of hornets ran me $2,000 CDN when all was said and done.

An IQ of 115 should be sufficient, and you can reasonably approximate that from your SAT score if you've never had a proper IQ test.   Learning mathematics is most importantly about your ability to cope with frustration. You have to have the discipline and the drive to keep working on a problem when you are stuck and baffled and you hate everything and want to give up. You have to be willing to go to office hours and ask other students for help when you get stuck. Some problems will take hours, or days, or weeks to solve. You will be stuck. You will hate it. So you put it away and come back to it later with a fresh mind.   I'm currently working on a math undergrad with a second major in the social \"sciences.\" I'm not a super genius but I work hard and get good grades, even in the upper division math courses.

I understand and appreciate the enormous cultural importance of that era but its focus on classical virtues, religious fervor, naturalistic formalism and lofty themes simply doesn't appeal to my sensibilities. What I do love however is the segment of that era's cultural output that moves away from the dominant paradigm towards something more unhinged, debauched, idiosyncratic, bon-vivant — think of it as the grotesque carnival, in contrast to the austere sermon — with artists like François Rabelais in literature, Peter Bruegel the Elder in painting or Clément Janequin in music.  Rabelais wrote Gargantua and Pantagruel, a satirical hot take which consists of five tomes' worth of elaborate shitposting (quite literally, as it contains a hearty dose of scatological humor) featuring two giants acting as retarded as humanely possible. Peter Bruegel the Elder often disguised himself as a peasant to attend popular (aka feral) celebrations for inspiration. He often injected proto-absurdist or fantastical themes in his work, like his Proverbs which depict folk sayings as actual human behavior.  Clément Janequin wrote a lot of chansons, a lot of which dealt with wholesome and/or hardcore sex with young virgins. Il Estoit une Fillette (\"Once Upon A Time, a Little Girl\") is about how a clever dude got to \"teach tricks\" to a lonely girl who proceeded to climax loudly.  Got anything like this?

The amount of light your lens lets in will not change, only the depth of field or the “blurry part” of the image. \"  I was calculating 35mm at f/8 and got 52.5 mm f/12  So what the fuck does that mean?

And the rise of science has fueled ever more specialized knowledge, that stunning and imprisoning progression so well-known by now.  >The complete objectification of time, so much with us today, was achieved by Issac Newton, who mapped the workings of the Galilean-Cartesian clockwork universe. Product of the severely repressed Puritan outlook, which focused on sublimating sexual energy into brutalizing labor, Newton spoke of absolute time, \"flowing equably without regard to anything external.\" Born in 1642, the year of Galileo's death, Newton capped the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century by developing a complete mathematical formulation of nature as a perfect machine, a perfect clock.  >The goal of establishing logic on mathematical grounds was related to an even more ambitious effort by the end of the nineteenth century, that of establishing the foundations of math itself. As capitalism proceeded to redefine reality in its own image and became desirous of securing its foundations, the \"logic\" stage of math in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fresh from new triumphs, sought the same. David Hilberts theory of formalism, one such attempt to banish contradiction or error, explicitly aimed at safeguarding \"the state power of mathematics for all time from all 'rebellions.'\"  >Heidegger felt that there is an inherent tendency for Western thinking to merge into the mathematical sciences, and saw science as \"incapable of awakening, and in fact emasculating, the spirit of genuine inquiry.\" We find ourselves, in an age when the fruits of science threaten to end human life altogether, when a dying capitalism seems capable of taking everything with it, more apt to want to discover the ultimate origins of the nightmare.  >When the world and its thought (Levi-Strauss and Chomsky come immediately to mind) reach a condition that is increasingly mathematized and empty (where computers are widely touted as capable of feelings and even of life itself), the beginnings of this bleak journey, including the origins of the number concept, demand comprehension. It may be that this inquiry is essential to save us and our humanness.  I hope you guys don't study math and continue to ruin the world.",

With Guaranteed, even if the client run away, the money will eventually spread evenly to everyone actively participating in said contest. > Don't make a shitty design, so that the mods will level up your designer level which gives you added benefit (It's not auto levelling, the mods review who deserve to level up and who doesn't based on quality not quantity). 99d have this leveling (basic-gold-platinum) thing to determine experience. The basic ones don't have any benefit and you can only join contest filled with these pissfuck copycat designers. The gold ones lets you join contest specifically for a more experienced designer (usually contest with higher $), and there'll be $ compensation for finalist. Platinum works the same with gold, you can join gold only contest plus platinum only contest, which usually have the most $$$. The higher the lvl and the more portfolio you have, clients will notice you most likely contact you for direct service instead them making another pissfuck contest.  I'm currently in Gold lvl but barely active in it since last year since I joined an agency. 99d or similar platform can be more profitable than being a agency's wageslave or in corporate. Personally, I use this platform mainly to built my skills & portfolio which then I showcase it in personal website and also make a portfolio page on instagram, which doubles to advertise my service.",

    "text": "The anabolic window is a period of time after lifting where nutrition is supposed to shift the bodies state from catabolic to anabolic to clear up any definition issues. Most people consider it to be immediately after lifting to thirty minutes after.  If you actually read the studies and metas on the anabolic window (protein timing) they are completely inconclusive. The problem for most is that they don't control for some really important shit that are probably significant extraneous variables. The best example of a failure for a creating an important control group is that they supplement whey protein after lifting and when a hypertrophy or strength increase happens they conclude that the protein timing is what caused it. They don't even think to consider the 20-50g of protein increase is what caused it because nutritionists are fucking morons. If the people participating in the study are not consuming enough protein in the first place ofc supplementing it at literally any fucking time through the day will cause a strength/hypertrophy increase. They should have one group doing a protein supplement several hours before the resistance training and one group that does it immediately after and another that does it a few hours after to control the study properly. This is just one example, the people that do these studies don't do them for a long enough time period (<6 weeks in most cases), use tiny groups (<100, or even <15 sometimes) or control what kind of resistance training they participate in for some hypertrophy measuring studies.  The end result is contradictory conclusions so there is no real good evidence for whether or not the anabolic window is a meme or not right now. Personally, I've seen most studies show that whey with a fast-digesting carb increases protein synthesis, which in turn decreases recovery. The problem is there is never proper control groups looking for extraneous variables.  tl;dr: nutritionsts are fucking idiots.",

But the author consistently sticks with \"Indian\" - except during the acknowledgements, aka outside the story itself (apparently she had members of said tribe help her). It might be that she's trying to portray her heroine as not the politically most sensitive ... well, I guess that's the problem these days; you just don't know.  There's a bit of the usual stereotypes: of course she's great with animals, and, oh, her herbal cures cure everything. Overall I felt it wasn't that well done (although it's not to the point of cheesy \"nature is everything!\" - for example, she bugs the heroine to buy an electric stove because she thinks they are simply more convenient and better...).  But then it's really not what the novel is about; although at first glance it kinda looks like it - the heroine is mixed-race and there's some comments about the town still being \"out of tradition\" somewhat segregated - so \"identity\" might have mattered, but I can't say I it felt central to the plot to me.   In unrelated news, Nicola Griffith (so like 1/3 of all great FF authors) has released a new novel! It's (again) about MS, and apparently is quite fucked up.  But I'm sure it's good stuff.",

    "text": "StarAndrea - Ships in Service 1, 2 Woo, I like this. Granted, I just generally like human<->non-human romances. Also granted, the \"ship\" is a \"she\" because she says so, not for any biological reasons ... although there's also a bunch of human lesbians around, so either way you get some FF content.  Anyway, it's about a suicidal, possibly autistic heroine going to work on a living ship, who is in love with her. And the human loves her back. I liked it, because that's not even up for debate - it's not (very) angsty or anything.  Of course, they try to figure things out, but overall it's more like a close friendship - also with the rest of the crew. The romance isn't truly in question - oh, and, yes, it goes into the \"sex\" thing, a little, which some might consider a bit creepy. Mostly though it's just slice-of-life stuff about living in a living ship and how that's all working and so on.  That being said, it's incredibly lean on descriptions. I've got no clue what the heroine looks like. Only a very vague idea what the ship looks like. Most of the time it's just sitting around with the weird heroine, the quirky ship (great character) and sometimes some other crew. Book 2 follows the Captain and the ship and their friendship more than the romance between the other heroine and the ship.  Anyway, it's fun. I like it.   There's simply no not-depressing outcome here. Either it's simply great book, then I'll be depressed afterwards because I know it'll be ages before I find another one. Or it's a great book, but is depressing because the content is depressing.",

Though I hope they don't ruin/ignore more \"side material\". Like the Akira drama cd that had her, Kiyoi and Run become friends and make plans to hangout. Oh, wait, they already ruined Akira. Though maybe we can have something between Milulun and Kiyoi, like Kiyoi trying to see if it's the real Run after hearing about Tama becoming a Lrig again, and Milulun confirms that it is her. She would then explain how she followed Akira's modeling career and social media, but noticed she hasn't gone back to her genki Aki-lucky self or become Aki-lovely again. After trying and failing to contact Akira (and Kiyoi) she wasn't sure what to do. Then she dreamnt about a white lady who asked if she wanted to be an Lrig again, and agrees to it in hopes of getting in contact with Akira again to try and help her get Aki-lovely again. Then the Akira episode happens and now Milulun is stuck with stuffy Kiyoi instead of helping her Aki-lovely.",

A gravure idol (グラビアアイドル gurabia aidoru), often abbreviated to gradol (グラドル guradoru), is a Japanese female model who primarily models on magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. Gravure idols appear in a wide range of photography styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality.

Oh yeah, because I fucking love Good n' Plenty. I will eat that shit until my jaw aches. I don't even care that it tastes weird and is made out of bugs.   Totally disagree. Shadow is consistently considered one of the series most popular characters while Ray and Mighty are the \"literally who?\"'s of the Sonic universe precisely because they have no identifying features or facts of interest. The most you can say for them is that Mighty was in two games no one has ever played and Ray is not Tails.

SA's sonic stages are so much fun because of all the old school cohesive randomness they had and how they give you a lot of different options on how to proceed or explore. The game also makes use of its mechanics well. There's the beginning of speed highway where in stead of running down the paths, you can jump on the floating platforms, jump to the right building, and go up it's side and find a capsule. There's also spindash jumping across the pits in red mountain or spindashing up the walls and over to the path that leads to the animal capsule in lost world.   The characters work well except for big and amy. Tails plays like you'd expect and his levels actually have agency due to them being races with sonic and eggman. Knuckles radar detects multiple emerald pieces at the same time and the areas are smaller then in SA2. 0102r's top speed and acceleration are fast and his levels are short and allow you enouth room to keep moving. Bigs gameplay is tedious and out of place even when you know how he plays and what to do and his slow speed and acceleration don't help. Amy has the same speed problems but would be fine if she was simply faster.   Also, the hubs make you feel like your in an actual world and are generally fun to explore. While the ones in SA2 are only selectable via level select. The completing mission and trial objectives are also more forgiving then A ranking in SA2.  Aside from big, amy, the casino and some lacking boss fights SA1 is very good in my eyes. I'm trying to get the final 5 chao emblems. Does anyone have some tips for the stat requirements?",

Anger is supposed to be scary.   Can the MCU not even take an emotion like Anger seriously. Ruffalo seems like a privileged ass bruce banner. He just acts himself.  Bruce Banner is a fuckin trainwreck of a human. That Thanos fight was complete bullshit. Hulk doesn't have a reason to be angry. Ruffalo just becomes hulk because people want him too, and 'im always angry'. Bitch you love black widow.  The anger is not respected. There is literally no anger in the mcu, such an important emotion, and hulk personifies that.  Hulk has so much potential. Bruce could see Romannoff get beaten the shit out off, and that could've been catharsis for Banner, and Hulk comes emerging out.

The small print of a lease is 'you will not own the car'. > Do I want to keep the car past the finance period? If 'no', then leasing may be for you. If yes, then just finance it the regular way, pay it off in three years (maybe four if you're a poorfag), and keep it until it starts going wrong.  If you have decent credit and don't get screwed by a used car dealership, you will get a decent finance rate. If they DO try and screw you, go for a personal loan instead.

But nowadays if you want escapism just play some video games, chat with your friends online, listen to music or watch Netflix. The car isn't as critical for basic social interaction anymore.

Is a society which aborts the unborn really any less harsh and brutish than one in which babies often die? For that matter, is the prevention of pregnancy and careful preservation of every child, no matter how flawed, a wiser method of population control than to allow sickly children to die of their own defects, or for the offspring of the weak or incompetent to die of not being provided for by their parents?  >As for the mythical \"maximum lifespan\" or whatever, we don't know if that has changed.

The arms are too long and it's throwing the proportions off badly, and the middle is too thin on the first picture. Unless they were going for a fantasy proportion sculpt (kinda how like DC or DZ does), but I'm not getting that vibe here.  At least they've got double jointed arms and legs, but enough companies do that now anyways where other options are gonna be a lot better to go with. It's unfortunate; this looks like they had good potential but didn't tweak with the body sculpts enough before putting them up for sale.

I didn't start asking for hand checks until I was in double digit x-ray exposures.   The film was kept in big Ziploc bags in the interior of my bag. During my trip I mailed 4 packages home with both developed and undeveloped rolls inside. Won't sugar coat it, travelling with that much film was a pretty huge pain in the ass.

Heidegger thought that Man could fix this error, he trusted the nazis to do it.

But (and if you're listening to these songs in bad quality you are missing out on this and a lot of important stuff) when you actually listen to everything in the mix (instead of saying \"it's a regular pop tune so I only have to dedicate half my attention towards it because it seems generic and boring\"), you notice how tastefully those synths are used through the whole song- most noticeably the chorus having these kind of soaring \"weeeeew woooooo\" whirling sounds, and these kind of bloop sounds (please forgive me as I wouldn't know what to call these sounds exactly) on the upbeats.

Their design is so far from a therapist's furniture they make it obvious that's not what they refering to I get what you're going for, but maybe the problem is that nobody sits on kitchen chairs in therapy. What's more, those really don't look like chairs I would *want* to sit in for a 50-minute session. Maybe you'd sit in chairs like that to have a late night bonding session with your bestie in the kitchen over coffee, but without other elements to convey that, the context of the chairs isn't so obvious. If you showed me straight-backed kitchen chairs with no cushions and told me it represented a therapist's office, I'd be worried about what the atmosphere was going to be like. It looks like it would be uncomfortable. That might not sound rational to you, but people who are actively looking for a therapist are often anxious or distraught in some way and are going to gravitate toward comfort.  If you have your mind set on having chairs in the logo, maybe have two armchairs? I agree that a chair and a sofa would be too obvious (especially given the Freudian reference in the business name), but if I see two armchairs, I'm going to get homey, comfortable connotations from it. That could make the difference between whether an anxious, depressed person feels comfortable calling that particular therapist's office and making an appointment or not.",

    "text": "I would personally advise against skirts. They're going into combat, not school.  As for that picture, it's a lot less stiff than the other one, but here are some critiques. Starting on the left: The eyepatch on the catgirl doesn't differentiate from her hair, unless that's supposed to be her hair, in which case hair doesn't form like that. The riding crop should be at the side and in the shoulder being parallel to the torso. Her hands are a bit too small. Her feet are angled inwards, when she seems to be doing an at-ease, which should result in feet being shoulder width apart and angled apart at ~45 degrees. Finally for this one, AKs are kept with the barrel facing up while slung over the shoulder, and I just now see that that's a sling and not a riding crop. Make it a little bit more thick next time, and keep the bottom part of the strap about the same width as the top.   Next girl has no left arm, not sure if that's intentional. If it's supposed to be behind her back, we'd still be able to see her elbow unless she was contorting it oddly. Hand is, again, a bit too small.  Braid's right leg is at a weird angle and looks like she's about to trip the girl on her right, assuming that they're roughly right next to each other. Hand is, again, a bit small.  Finally: hands, arms, legs, and head are disproportionately small to the rest of twin tails body. Her body's twisting down like she's trying to get into position to shoulder check someone, but her entire body has turned, and not just her torso. Not sure how to fix it, but it looks wrong, so maybe you can figure out how to fix it if you re-draw it.  As a final note, a Soviet wouldn't know what the Peace sign was, as that was an American thing.",

    "text": "Eh, when it comes to the skirts or the peace sign, they're supposed to be schoolgirls in a military themed academy in the 21st century ; they have access to all of the culture we have now and thus the same references. When going to a real fight, they wear the same BDU trousers as real life oper8ors.  Now, going to the details : -There's an eyepatch on the girl on the left, which is partially covered by hair ; it was supposed to be clearer, buuut the paper was handled and thus some lines that used to be clear were blurred. -She isn't holding a riding crop, but the sling of pic related, which I thought looked easier to carry with the barrel pointing fownwards.The bottom part of the sling is thinner because I tried to make it look like it's at an angle. Finally, the girl herself is in an awkward position, but that's actually done on purpose because it's a part of her personnality. -Next girl has her left hand in her pocket and is facing 11 o'clock if the viewer is at 12, so her elbow is behind her in that position. -Braids and twintails are supposed to be wrestling, the drawing doesn't make it really clear, but they are.  -Twintails is at 11 o'clock as well, and wrestling with the previous girl, and since she has a skittish personnality, she tries both to evade twintails' grip and to make it look like she isn't evading.

I think the implication was that from the beginning, the bunker and every unit on it was a disposable asset and the unspecified leaders of the resistance that YorHa is a part of (because it goes over the bunker Commander's head and there are other YorHa forces around from other bases) had essentially designed the Bunker and YorHa in general to be vulnerable so that when it inevitably fell, they could salvage the combat data and weak points and use them to make the next in an endless spiral of upgraded units. The machines (well, specifically the Red Girl AIs that are the foundation of the network) simply evolved past playing the little game of back and forth and went nuclear to try and reach new levels of consciousness.",

It's not exactly secret but not exactly openly seeing each other either.  The Prince's friends worry about her---why are you spending time with *her*? Don't you know she's bad news? You shouldn't fall in with a bad crowd---but the Prince laughs it off. \"Don't worry, girls. I've never missed any homework or stayed out too late and disobeyed my mother, and I'm not going to start now.\" They giggle and swoon at how charming she is.  That's not what she tells the Delinquent when they're together. She's sick of being the perfect girl, the one everyone in the class respects, but she doesn't know how not to be; she can only be herself with the Delinquent because the Delinquent's the only one who'll listen and then won't tell half the class behind her back. Neither of them really know what they want to do after school, when they'll actually have to choose a life for themselves instead of filling their natural roles at school.  She's worried about the Delinquent. She'll go out at odd hours and get into fights and other trouble, just because she can; the Prince daren't ask where that watch came from. The Prince goes along sometimes and laughs and has fun, but still looks at the Delinquent with concern; more often, she sends a text to no reply and only learns where she's been the next day, when she turns up at school with cuts and bruises and yesterday's clothes.

Her attitude's terrible, but she's not stupid. The Prince offers to help the Delinquent study---she's the Prince, after all, and even if she complains about it, she's going to try to be valiant and help out. \"Do I look like the type to study?\" \"I don't know. Do I look like the type to go out with you?\"  The Delinquent keeps up her doesn't-give-a-fuck attitude and even starts to get annoyed with the Prince; she goes missing more and more often, not returning texts and abandoning their hang-out spots. For her part, the Prince is starting to get annoyed back---she starts wondering if it's for the best that their lives are going to diverge soon. She doesn't need this stress on top of exams.  Results day. Top results in everything for the Prince: place at Todai confirmed, and her fangirls are swooning over her success. She accepts the congratulations with a perfectly polite smile and laugh, then pushes her way to find the Delinquent and offer her commiserations; she's going to say that they should enjoy the summer together and leave each other with fond memories. Except the Delinquent shows her her results: upper third of the class, and she has an offer from Soka University. They can stay together! Those increased mysterious absences were when she was studying and she was too proud to admit to it, and didn't want to get the Prince's hopes up. The Prince, for once, can't be stoic; crying, she hugs the Delinquent, who we see smile for the first time.",
